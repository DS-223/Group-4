# 🏡 Predicting Real Estate Prices for Buying or Renting

**Marketing Analytics Project**  
The real estate market is volatile in Armenia, and both buyers and renters face challenges in determining the appropriate price for properties. Consumers often rely on intuition or outdated information, leading to suboptimal financial decisions. A platform that accurately predicts house prices can assist both buyers/renters and real estate investors in making informed decisions.
