# Real Estate Price Prediction Platform

---

## 1. Overview

This project, developed by Group 4 for the Spring 2025 Marketing Analytics course at the American University of Armenia, provides a predictive analytics platform for Armenia’s real estate market. It helps users estimate rental and sale prices for properties based on key features like location, area, and type.

The system integrates a Streamlit UI, FastAPI backend, trained ML models, and a PostgreSQL database — all containerized with Docker.

## 2. Problem

The Armenian real estate market is volatile and lacks pricing transparency. Buyers and renters often rely on intuition or outdated listings, which leads to poor financial decisions. There's no fast or reliable way to know what a fair price is for a specific property.

---

## 3. Solution

Our solution is a full-stack analytics tool that allows users to:

- Enter property details via a simple UI
- View predicted sale and rent prices instantly
- Explore price insights via visual feedback

**Under the hood:**

- FastAPI handles the API logic and ML requests
- PostgreSQL stores structured property data
- A machine learning model trained on 3,000+ entries produces accurate estimates
- All components are fully Dockerized and documented

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes

- **More Accurate Pricing Decisions** for both renters and buyers
- **Reduced Guesswork** thanks to data-driven predictions
- **Better Insights** into property value based on real features
- **Documentation & Extensibility** for future enhancements

---

## 5. Summary

This platform represents a complete pipeline from ETL to ML-powered predictions. It enables smarter decision-making in a space where intuition has traditionally ruled. With future improvements like real-time data scraping and map visualizations, this project lays the groundwork for a robust real estate recommendation engine.
